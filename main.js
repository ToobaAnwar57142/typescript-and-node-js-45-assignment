//More Conditional Tests: You don’t have to limit the number of tests you create to 10. If you want to try more comparisons, write more tests. Have at least one True and one False result for each of the following:
//• Tests for equality and Inequality Test no: 01 
console.log("Equality test with strings:", "Apple" === "Apple");
//• Tests for equality and Inequality Test no: 02
console.log("Inequality test with test strings:", "Apple" != "Orange");
//• Tests using the lower case function
console.log("Lower Case function test:", "HELLO".toLowerCase() === "hello");
//• Numerical tests involving equality 
console.log("Equality test with number:", 57 === 57);
//• Numerical tests involving inequality
console.log("Inequailty test with numbers:", 57 != 14);
//greater than test
console.log("Greater than test:", 10 > 5);
//less than test
console.log("Greater than test:", 10 < 5);
//greater than or equal to
console.log("Greater than and test:", 10 >= 10);
//less than or equal to
console.log("less than or equal to test", 5 <= 10);
//• Tests using "and" operator
console.log("And operator test:", 5 === 5 && 10 > 5);
//Test using "or" operator
console.log("or operator test: ", 5 === 5 || false);
//• Test whether an item is in a array
var fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Mango'];
console.log('Test "Apple" in the array:', fruits.includes("Apple"));
//Test whether an item is not in a array
console.log('Testing "Apple" is not in a array: ', !fruits.includes('Apple'));
